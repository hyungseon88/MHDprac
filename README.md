# MHDprac

### README file for MHD Practice

This is a set of sample codes for practicing magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations. 
The codes are written in Python and make use of the NumPy and Matplotlib libraries. 
The following instructions will guide you through the installation and usage of these codes.

### Installation:

- Install Python 3.x from the official website.
- Install NumPy and Matplotlib libraries using pip command: pip install numpy matplotlib.
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

### Usage:

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
Run the desired Python file by typing 
~~~
python filename.py
~~~
in the terminal.
The simulation results will be displayed in a separate window.

### Contents:

- Caution on the each scheme

### Notes:

These codes are provided for educational purposes only and are not optimized for performance. They
are intended to serve as examples of how to implement MHD simulations in Python. The MHD equations
are a complex system of nonlinear partial differential equations. These codes are not intended to 
provide a complete or accurate simulation of any specific physical phenomenon, but rather to illustrate 
some basic concepts of MHD simulations.
